0. Pre-processing function to convert light induction expt data to per second format
1. Fit model to data
2. Validate model with unseen data
3. Optimize light pattern
4. Run new experiment with unseen light pattern to confirm
5. Implement PID and MPC
6. Try using PID and MPC to control light induction
7. Implement PPO
8. Try training PPO on ODE model
9. Try using PPO to control light induction
10. Implement one/few-shot learning to generalize to new systems/conditions

0. Write tests for all modules
1. Look into Usiigaci (mask-rcnn) and Trackpy for cell tracking instead of SORT
2. Improve autofocus algorithm
    Take slope of focus level into account
    Specify "offset" to target different focal planes of a cell
