1. Fit model to data
2. Validate model with unseen data - 5sec/60sec
3. Optimize light pattern
4. Run new experiment with optimal light pattern
5. Implement PID and MPC
6. Try using PID and MPC to control light induction
7. Implement PPO
8. Try training PPO on ODE model
9. Try using PPO to control light induction
10. Implement one/few-shot learning to generalize to new systems/conditions

1. Look into Usiigaci (mask-rcnn) and Trackpy for cell tracking instead of SORT
2. Write tests for all modules
3. Improve autofocus algorithm
    Implement CNN for autofocusing
