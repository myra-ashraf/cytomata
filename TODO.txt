1. Fit model to data
2. Validate model with unseen data - 5sec/60sec
3. Optimize light pattern
4. Run new experiment with optimal light pattern
5. Implement PID and MPC
6. Try using PID and MPC to control light induction
7. Implement PPO
8. Try training PPO on ODE model
9. Try using PPO to control light induction
10. Implement one/few-shot learning to generalize to new systems/conditions

0. Write tests for all modules
1. Look into Usiigaci (mask-rcnn) and Trackpy for cell tracking instead of SORT
2. Improve autofocus algorithm
    Test brent's method
    Specify "offset" to target different focal planes of a cell
    Implement CNN for autofocusing
3. Maybe use natsort + skimageio instead of PIMS
4. Delete directories when restarting for setup_dirs
4. Autogenerate gifs/mp4s for ave frame/single cell processes
5. URGENT: why are there sudden illumination changes throughout timelapse this past month?
    = Test time lapse with no autofocus movement
    = Test time lapse with heater off
    = Test time lapse with the 35mm holder ring
