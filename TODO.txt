To Do List
============================
1. Run Cartpole with openai DQN --> Simplest case
    a. Simple observation and action space
    b. Not image based
    Result: Works well! Only took ~20 min
    Status: DONE
    Warning: apparently set_global_seeds causes the unstable training?!?
2. Run Pong with openai DQN --> More complex example
    a. Still simple action space
    b. Image based --> Requires CNN and atari wrappers
    Result: Works well. Took ~7 hours
    Status: Still need to test with different wrappers enabled
    = How does changing the FC layers from 256 --> 512 affect training?
3. Run Breakout with openai DQN --> More difficult example
    a. Known to converge slower
    Status: WIP
4. Run Bank Heist or Star Gunner on openai DQN --> larger action space
    a. Similar action and observation space to cytomatrix
    Status: WIP
5. Run flappybird with yenchen DQN --> is it a pygame issue?
    Status: WIP
6. Run flappybird with with openai DQN --> is it an openai DQN issue?
    Status: WIP
7. Run WaterWorld with openai DQN
    a Most similar case to cytomatrix
